Unfinished keylogger AC for FiveM [CLIENT SIDE]

Currently, I don't have time to deal with this project, maybe someone will be interested and will finish it.
It can be useful against console executors.

### How it works?

- It recognize words you typing, so if you basically type /exec or sth like that you will get banned
- Unfortunately, banning system is not working, because it should be on server side of anticheat :(
- It does not save content in any way, it only checks whether it is blacklisted

### What remains to be done?

- Force players to open .exe file when they are playing on server
- Some bypass protection of not opening .exe file
- Server side - ban system, getting player and stuff like that
- Client <-> Server communication (maybe with websocket idk), to ban cheater
